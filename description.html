          <b>Information technology (IT)</b> is the use of computers to create,
          process, store, retrieve, and exchange all kinds of electronic data
          and information. IT is typically used within the context of business
          operations as opposed to personal or entertainment technologies. IT is
          considered to be a subset of information and communications technology
          (ICT). An information technology system (IT system) is generally an
          information system, a communications system, or, more specifically
          speaking, a computer system — including all hardware, software, and
          peripheral equipment — operated by a limited group of IT users.<br /><br />Humans
          have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and communicating
          information since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in
          about 3000 BC. However, the term information technology in its modern
          sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard
          Business Review; authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler
          commented that "the new technology does not yet have a single
          established name. We shall call it information technology (IT)."Their
          definition consists of three categories: techniques for processing,
          the application of statistical and mathematical methods to
          decision-making, and the simulation of higher-order thinking through
          computer programs.<br /><br />The term is commonly used as a synonym
          for computers and computer networks, but it also encompasses other
          information distribution technologies such as television and
          telephones. Several products or services within an economy are
          associated with information technology, including computer hardware,
          software, electronics, semiconductors, internet, telecom equipment,
          and e-commerce.<br /><br />Based on the storage and processing
          technologies employed, it is possible to distinguish four distinct
          phases of IT development: pre-mechanical (3000 BC — 1450 AD),
          mechanical (1450—1840), electromechanical (1840—1940), and electronic
          (1940 to present). This article focuses on the most recent period
          (electronic).<br /><br />Information technology is also a branch of
          computer science, which can be defined as the overall study of
          procedure, structure, and the processing of various types of data. As
          this field continues to evolve across the world, the overall priority
          and importance has also grown, which is where we begin to see the
          introduction of computer science-related courses in K-12 education.
          However, concerns have been raised about this fact that most schools
          are lacking advanced-placement courses in this field.
